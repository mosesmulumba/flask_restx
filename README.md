# RESTful API Simulation with Flask-RESTX

This Flask application provides a simulated RESTful API built with the Flask-RESTX extension. It demonstrates the core functionalities of a RESTful API, allowing you to explore and experiment with API development using Flask.

* Key Features:

Leverages Flask for a lightweight and flexible web framework.
Utilizes Flask-RESTX to simplify API definition and documentation generation.
Simulates common RESTful API actions like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

* Benefits:

Provides a clear understanding of RESTful API concepts.
Facilitates rapid prototyping and testing of API endpoints.
Offers a foundation for building more complex APIs in the future.
Getting Started:

# Clone this repository.
Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt 

Run the application: python app.py (or flask run if using the FLASK_APP environment variable)

# API Documentation:

You can access API documentation generated by Flask-RESTX if you visit the http://127.0.0.1:5000 with the swagger UI you can play around with the API.

# Further Development:

This application serves as a starting point for building more comprehensive RESTful APIs. You can expand on it by:

Implementing additional API endpoints with various functionalities.
Integrating with a database for persistent data storage.
Adding authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to this project!
